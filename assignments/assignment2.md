# Theory of Computation Assignment 2: Computability

## Overview

Assignment prompt: Do something interesting related to
computability not covered in class.

If you are unsure if a topic counts, just ask. Please turn in a
substantive report including any proofs, equations, diagrams,
etc. used. Alternatively, turn in a well-documented code
project. If a report is chosen, latex or markdown is recommended
(but not required). If generative AI is used, include
screenshots of the chat. Please cite (or at least list) any
outside sources.

Examples:
- Prove something is undecidable
- Write a proof by reduction not covered in class
- Detail some interesting pre-existing result in computability
