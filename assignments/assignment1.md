# Theory of Computation Assignment 1: Automata and Languages

## Overview

Assignment prompt: Do something interesting related to automata
and/or languages not covered in class.

If you are unsure if a topic counts, just ask. Please turn in a
substantive report including any proofs, equations, diagrams,
etc. used. Alternatively, turn in a well-documented code
project. If a report is chosen, latex or markdown is recommended
(but not required). If generative AI is used, include
screenshots of the chat. Please cite (or at least list) any
outside sources.

Examples:
- Prove something is Turing complete
- Writeup an obscure type of automaton
- Write a program simulating a class of automaton
