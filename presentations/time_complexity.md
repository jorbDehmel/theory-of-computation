# Time complexity classes, `P` and `NP`

Textbook: Chapter 7.2, 7.3

# Polynomial time

# The class `P`

# Verifiers

# Nondeterministic polynomial time

# The class `NP`

# Does `P = NP`?

# Satisfiability

# Polynomial-time mapping reducibility

# `NP`-completeness

# Cook-Levin theorem ($SAT$ is NP-complete)
