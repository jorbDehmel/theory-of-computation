# Sizing infinite sets

- The size of a finite set is the number of elements in it
- What about infinite sets?
- We can show that a set $A$ is the same size as another, $B$,
    by making a **1-to-1 mapping** from each element of $A$ to
    $B$
    - This is called a **correspondence**
- This works even for infinite sets!

# Examples

**Ex:** An infinite amount of $\$100$ bills and an infinite
amount of $\$1$ bills **are worth the same amount.**

**Ex:** Are there more integers ($\mathbb{Z}$) or even integers
($2 \mathbb{Z}$)? It would seem that, since only half of all
integers are even, that there would be more of them. However,
**this isn't true!**

Let $f: \mathbb{Z} \to 2 \mathbb{Z}$ be the function
$f(k) = 2k$. This is a **bidirectional mapping**, so the sets it
maps to and from must be the same size!

# Different infinity sizes

**Ex:** Is the set of all natural numbers
$\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$ the same size as the set
of all real numbers (EG $\pi, 4, \frac{1}{2}, e, \ldots$)? They
are both infinite, so one would assume so.

As it turns out, **no**! Some infinities are larger than others.

# Cantor's diagonalization proof for $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{R}$

**Thm:** There are more real numbers between 0 and 1 than
natural numbers 0 to $\infty$.

**Pf:** We will try to construct an arbitrary-order table where
the first column is an increasing integer index starting at 0
and the second column is a list of all the real numbers from 0
to 1. If there are the same number, all reals will be contained
in this list.

 Index    | Real number
----------|---------------------------
 $0$      | $c_0 = 0.12345678 \ldots$
 $1$      | $c_1 = 0.31415926 \ldots$
 $2$      | $c_2 = 0.27182818 \ldots$
 $3$      | $c_3 = 0.00000000 \ldots$
 $4$      | $c_4 = 0.99999999 \ldots$
 $\vdots$ | $\vdots$

# Cantor pt. 2

Now we construct a new number $c^\prime$. The $i$-th decimal
digit of $c^\prime$ will be one more than the $i$-th digit of
$c_i$ (or 0 if it was 9). By definition, $c^\prime$ is not in
our list (it is different from every element in at least one
digit)!

$c_0 = 0.\boldsymbol{1}2345 \ldots$ \
$c_1 = 0.3\boldsymbol{1}415 \ldots$ \
$c_2 = 0.27\boldsymbol{1}82 \ldots$ \
$c_3 = 0.000\boldsymbol{0}0 \ldots$ \
$c_4 = 0.9999\boldsymbol{9} \ldots$ \
$\vdots$ \
$c^\prime = 0.\boldsymbol{22210} \ldots$ \

Since we already used every natural number for indices,
**there must be more real numbers than natural ones.** End of
proof.

**Note:** We used the range $[0, 1]$, but this holds for any
$[a, b]: a, b \in \mathbb{R}$! There are more real numbers
between any two real numbers than there are natural numbers.

# Infinity sizes

**Def:** An infinite set is said to be **countable** if it is
finite or there exists a correspondence between it and the
natural numbers.

- Ex: Natural numbers, even numbers, odd numbers, rational
    numbers, **finite-length strings**

**Def:** An infinite set is said to be **uncountable** iff there
exists a correspondence between it and the real numbers.

- Ex: Real numbers, the power set of natural numbers,
    **infinite strings over any alphabet $|\Sigma| > 1$**

# Proving unrecognizable languages exist

**Thm:** There are more languages on any $\Sigma : |\Sigma| > 1$
than there are Turing machines.

**Pf:** We will prove the set of all Turing machines is
countably infinite, while the set of all languages on $\Sigma$
is uncountably infinite. Therefore, there are undecidable
languages on every alphabet.

# Encoding TMs in finite binary strings

**Def:** An **encoding** onto alphabet $\Sigma$ of a TM
$M$ is some finite string $\left< M \right> \in \Sigma^*$ which
can be used by a UTM to simulate $M$.

**This is intentionally vague!** Just convince yourself that
such a string exists and is finite for all valid TMs.

**Def:** A binary encoding of a TM encodes it onto alphabet
$\{0, 1\}$.

# Language characteristic strings

- A language on an alphabet $\Sigma$ is some (possibly infinite)
    subset of $\Sigma^*$
- Without loss of generality, let us assume $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$
    (the smallest useful alphabet)
- Then $\Sigma^*$ is $\{ \epsilon, 0, 1, 01, 10, 11, \ldots \}$
- Let $\sigma_i$ be the $i$-th element of $\Sigma^*$ (0-indexed)
- **Note:** Every $\sigma_i$ is of finite length!

**Def:** The characteristic string $c_L$ of language $L$ on
alphabet $\Sigma$ is an **infinite** binary string
$c = c_0 c_1 c_2 \cdots c_i \cdots$ where $c_i = 1$ iff
$\sigma_i \in L$.

- Ex: $c_{\emptyset} = 0000000\cdots$
- Ex: $c_{\Sigma^*} = 1111111\cdots$
- Ex: $c_{\{ \epsilon \}} = 1000000\cdots$
- Ex: $c_{\{ 1, 11 \}} = 0010001\cdots$

# Diagonalizing the TMs

Create a table such that:

- Every TM $M_i$'s binary encoding $a_i$ is in one column
- The characteristic string $c_i$ of $\mathcal{L}(M_i)$ (the set
    all strings *recognized* by $M_i$) is in the other
- By convention, let any invalid TM encoding have a
    characteristic string of all 0 (follows from UTM def.)

TM Binary encoding        | Characteristic string
--------------------------|-------------------------
 $a_0 = 00000$            | $c_0 = 01010101 \ldots$
 $a_1 = 111111111$        | $c_1 = 11111111 \ldots$
 $a_2 = 0$                | $c_2 = 00000000 \ldots$
 $a_3 = 1111 \ldots 1111$ | $c_3 = 10101111 \ldots$
 $\vdots$                 | $\vdots$

**Every TM is listed in the left column.**

# Diagonalization pt. 2

Let $c^{\prime}$ be an infinite binary characteristic string. Let
the $i$-th bit of $c^{\prime}$ be the negation of the $i$-th bit
of $c_i$.

TM Binary encoding        | Characteristic string
--------------------------|-------------------------
 $a_0 = 0000 \ldots 0000$ | $c_0 = \boldsymbol{0}101 \ldots$
 $a_1 = 111111111$        | $c_1 = 1\boldsymbol{1}11 \ldots$
 $a_2 = 0$                | $c_2 = 00\boldsymbol{0}0 \ldots$
 $a_3 = 1111 \ldots 1111$ | $c_3 = 101\boldsymbol{0} \ldots$
 $\vdots$                 | $\vdots$

$c^{\prime} = \boldsymbol{1011} \ldots$

**The language of $c^{\prime}$ is not recognized by the list!**
Since the list has every TM, no TM recognizes $c^{\prime}$: It
is said to be **unrecognizable**.

**Therefore, some languages are not recognizable.**

# Proving the acceptance problem is recognizable

**Def:** The acceptance problem. Given some TM $M$ and input
$w$, does $M$ accept? We define the language $A_{TM}$ ($A$ for
"accept") to be:

$$
A_{TM} = \{ \left< M, w \right> :
    M \texttt{ is a TM and accepts } w \}
$$

**Thm:** The acceptance problem ($A_{TM}$) is *recognizable* (a
positive answer can be given, but not always in finite time).

**Pf:** By construction. Let $A$ be a UTM taking input
$\left< M, w \right>$ and accepting only if $M(w)$ halts. Being
a UTM, it can simulate $M(w)$. If $M(w)$ ever halts, $A$
accepts. By definition, $A$ recognizes (but doesn't decide)
$A_{TM}$. End of proof.

# Proving the acceptance problem is undecidable

**Thm:** $A_{TM}$ is undecidable.

**Pf:** By contradiction. Assume $A_{TM}$ is decidable. Then
there exists a TM $H$ **deciding** $A_{TM}$. We will derive a
contradiction similar to Russell's paradox.

$$
H(\left< M, w \right>) = \begin{cases}
    accept & \texttt{ if } M \texttt{ accepts } w \\
    reject & \texttt{ if } M \texttt{ rejects or loops on } w \\
\end{cases}
$$

Let $D$ be a new TM using $H$ as a subroutine (this is legal).
Since $H$ is a decider, it always completes in finite time. We
will design $D$ to be a decider as well.

# Acceptance problem undecidability pt. 2

$D$ = "On input $\left< M \right>$, where $M$ is a TM:

1. Run $H$ on input $\left< M, \left< M \right> \right>$
    (determine whether $M$ halts when given its own
    description)

2. If $H$ accepted, **reject**. If $H$ rejected,
    **accept**."

This means that $D(\left< M \right>)$ accepts if
$M(\left< M \right>)$ rejects or loops and rejects if
$M(\left< M \right>)$ accepts.

**What happens if we run $D(\left< D \right>)$?**

# Acceptance problem undecidability pt. 3

$$
D(\left< D \right>) = \begin{cases}
    accept & \texttt{ if } D \texttt{ rejects or loops on }
        \left< D \right> \\
    reject & \texttt{ if } D \texttt{ accepts }
        \left< D \right> \\
\end{cases}
$$

- If $D(\left< D \right>)$ accepts:
    - By definition, this means it must reject
    - **Contradiction!**

- If $D(\left< D \right>)$ rejects:
    - By definition, this means it must accept
    - **Contradiction!**

Therefore, $D(\left< D \right>)$ accepts if and only if it does
not: A contradiction. The assumption that $A_{TM}$ is decidable
must be false. End of proof.

**Proven by Church and Turing in 1936.**

# Computability theory

- There is at least one problem that **cannot be solved!**
- Similar to Kurt GÃ¶del, who proved there are true statements
    that have no proof
- Now we know not to look for an algorithm for $A_{TM}$: It
    cannot be *decided*

**Are there languages which cannot even be recognized?**

- If so, no machine could test for membership, let alone in
    finite time

# Co-Turing-recognizability

**Def:** A language $L$ is said to be **co-Turing-recognizable**
if its complement $\overline{L}$ is Turing-recognizable.

**Thm:** A language is decidable iff it is Turing-recognizable
and co-Turing-recognizable. (pf excluded, but intuitive)

**Corollary:** A language is undecidable iff it or its
complement are not Turing-recognizable.

**Note:** All languages which are Turing *decidable* are
trivially co-Turing-decidable and vice versa.

# A Turing-unrecognizable language

**Thm:** $\overline{A_{TM}}$ is not Turing-recognizable.

**Pf:** Since $A_{TM}$ is undecidable, either it or its
complement must be Turing-unrecognizable. We already proved
$A_{TM}$ is Turing-recognizable. Therefore, $\overline{A_{TM}}$
must be Turing-unrecognizable. End of proof.

- We have proved the undecidability of $A_{TM}$ **manually**
- We used a paradoxical "trick"
- What if no "trick" can be found? We need another way!
