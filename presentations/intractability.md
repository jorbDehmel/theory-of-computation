# Tractability vs. Intractability

**Def:** A language $A$ is **tractable** ("realistically"
solvable) if $A \in P$. It is **intractable** (theoretically
solvable, but not in "realistic" time) if $A \notin P$.

- In reality, there are plenty of language $\in P$ that are
    infeasible to decide IRL: $O(n^{999999})$ is technically
    "tractable"

- Exponential cost will eventually overtake **any** polynomial

# Space Constructability

- Recall: A function runs with deterministic **space**
    complexity $O(f(n))$ if it uses space $f(n)$ on input length
    $n$
- **Def:** A function $f$ is **space-constructable** if a TM can
    map any string of length $x$ to $f(x)$ in space $O(f(x))$
- Space-constructable function examples
    - $\lg(n)$
    - $n \lg(n)$
    - $n^2$

# Space Hierarchy Theorems

- Clearly, $SPACE(n) \subseteq SPACE(n^2)$ since $n$ is $O(n^2)$
- How can we prove that two space complexity classes are
    different, e.g. $SPACE(n) \subsetneq SPACE(n^2)$?

**Thm:** Space hierarchy theorem. For any space-constructable
$f$, a language $A$ exists that is decidable in $O(f(n))$ space
but **not** in $o(f(n))$ space.

- $A$ is decidable with space bounded by $f(n)$, but cannot be
    decided with space insignificant to $f(n)$

**Corollary:** For any nonnegative integers
$\epsilon_1, epsilon_2$ where $0 \le \epsilon_1 < \epsilon_2$,

$$
SPACE(n^{\epsilon_1}) \subsetneq SPACE(n^{\epsilon_2})
$$

- Finally, a proper hierarchy! This is very useful!

# Space Hierarchy Proof pt. 1

**Pf:** By construction. Let $A$ be the language of the
following Turing Machine.

```py
# Returns whether M rejects M in space f(n)
def D(inp) -> bool: # inp is of form <M>10*
    M, w = decode_TM_input_pair(inp) # w is 10*
    n = len(inp)
    number_of_steps = 0
    while number_of_steps < 2 ** f(n):
        # True, False, or None
        result = M.one_step_with_input(inp)
        if M.memory_usage > f(n):
            return False
        elif result is None:
            number_of_steps += 1
        else:
            return not result
    return False
```

# Space Hierarchy Proof pt. 2

- $D$ clearly uses at most $O(f(n))$ space
- Now, the space hierarchy theorem is proven only if $D$'s
    language is not decidable in space $o(f(n))$

**Lemma:** $A$ is not decidable in space $o(f(n))$.

**Pf:** Assume to the contrary that some TM $M$ decides $A$ in
space $g(n)$ where $g(n)$ is $o(f(n))$.

What if we run $D$ from before on this new $M$?

Because $g(n)$ is $o(f(n))$, there will always exist some $n_0$
for any constant $d$ such that, for all $n > n_0$,
$d g(n) < f(n)$. Therefore, $D$ can correctly simulate $M$ as
input as long as $n > n_0$. We can force this condition by
giving it input $\left<M\right>10^{n_0}$.

# Space Hierarchy Proof pt. 3

When $D$ takes in $\left<M\right>10^{n_0}$, it will decode and
run it. Since the input is long enough, it will not exceed the
time limit. Since $g(n)$ is $o(f(n))$, it will not exceed the
space limit. By assumption, $D$ must decide $A$ (the same
language as $M$): However, $D(\left<M\right>10^{n_0})$ does the
**opposite** of $M(\left<M\right>10^{n_0})$! Contradiction.

# Time Constructability

- Time complexities give us a lot more trouble than space ones
- If we could prove that $P \subsetneq NP$ like we can prove
    $PSPACE = NPSPACE$, we could settle the $P$/$NP$ debate
- Thus, we try to do the same with time

**Def:** A function $t$ where $t(n)$ is at least $O(n \log n)$
is called **time constructible** if a TM can map input of length
$n$ to $t(n)$ in deterministic time $O(t(n))$.

- Examples: $n \log n$, $n \sqrt{n}$, $n^2$, $2^n$

# Time Hierarchy Theorems

**Thm:** Time hierarchy theorem. For any time constructible
function $t$, a language $A$ exists that is decidable in
$O(t(n))$ time but not in time

$$
o \left( \frac{t(n)}{\log t(n)} \right)
$$

- Subtly different, and therefore less strong!

**Corollary:** For functions $t_1, t_2$ where $t_2$ is time
constructable and $t_1$ is
$o \left( \frac{t_2(n)}{\log t_2(n)} \right)$,

$$
TIME(t_1(n)) \subsetneq TIME(t_2(n))
$$

- Pf. excluded, but follows the same process as for space

# $EXPSPACE$-Completeness

- Recall: $EXPSPACE$ is the set of all problems solvable given
    exponential space
- $EXPSPACE = \bigcup_{k} SPACE( a^{n^k} )$
- Any algorithm in $P$ must be in $PSPACE$, since we can't use
    more than a constant number of memory "units" per time step
- A polynomial-time reduction cannot use more than polynomial
    space

**Def:** A language $B$ is **$EXPSPACE$-complete** if both:

1. $B \in EXPSPACE$
2. If language $A$ is in $EXPSPACE$, $A$ is polynomial-time
    reducible to $B$

# Relativization

- We previously used oracle Turing Machines to do reductions
- We briefly mentioned that an oracle call is assumed to take a
    single computation
- What if we redefine a problem's time complexity with respect
    to an oracle?

**Def:** For some language $A$, let $T^A$ denote a TM that can
decide $A$ in a single step (equivalently, a TM that has an
oracle for $A$). $P^A$ is the set of all languages decidable in
polynomial time by a TM with an oracle for $A$. Similarly,
$NP^A$ is the set of all languages decidable in nondeterministic
polynomial time given an oracle for $A$.

# Relativization Example

- We know $SAT$ is $NP$-complete: Any $A \in NP$ is polynomial
    time decidable if $SAT$ is
- Therefore, $NP \subseteq P^{SAT}$
- Indeed, we know of languages $A$ and $B$ such that
    $P^A \ne NP^A$ and $P^B = NP^B$

# Circuit Complexity

**Def:** A Boolean circuit is a Directed **Acyclic** Graph (DAG)
from some set of inputs $\{x_1, x_3, \ldots, x_i\}$ to a single
output, where every node has an in-degree of 1 or 2 an
out-degree of 1. Every node represents $\land$, $\lor$, or
$\lnot$.

# Circuit Families and Attributes

A circuit's **size** is the number of nodes, whereas a circuit's
**depth** is the length of the longest path from an input to the
output. Every circuit with $n$ inputs describes some
$f: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$.

A **circuit family** $C = (C_0, C_1, C_2, \ldots)$ is an
infinite list of circuits where $C_{i}$ has $i$ inputs. We say
$C$ decides $A \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\{0, 1\})$ if for every
string $w$, $w \in A$ iff $C_{|w|}(w) = 1$.

A circuit is **size minimal** if no smaller circuit does what it
does. The same holds for depth. The **size complexity** of a
circuit family $C$ is a function $f$ such that $f(n)$ is the
size of $C_n$. The **depth complexity** is a function $f$ such
that $f(n)$ is the depth of $C_n$.

**Ex:** $A$ is the language of strings that contain an odd
number of $1$s. $A$ has circuit complexity $O(n)$.

Since circuits simulate Boolean formulae and $SAT$ is
$NP$-complete, circuit satisfiability is also $NP$-complete.
Boolean circuits are known to be Turing-equivalent by the same
methods of the Cook-Levin theorem / TM GÃ¶del-ization
