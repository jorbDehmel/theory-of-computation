# Final: Theory of Computation
Colorado Mesa University

If generative AI is used in the production of your submission to
this assignment, you must disclose the ways in which it was
used to avoid loss of credit. Be prepared to thoroughly defend
your answers verbally or in (hand) writing.

## Part 1: Final Paper

Write a detailed final paper (including code as-needed) about an
interesting topic or field within the theory of computer
science. This paper should be a formally formatted `pdf`,
so `latex`, `markdown`, `rmd`, or comparable alternative should
be used. This paper should have a bibliography containing at
least one published and/or peer-reviewed source other than the
textbook. `bibtex` is recommended, but any format of formal
bibliography is acceptable. Project ideas should be approved by
instructor before substantial work has been put in. Both
research and thorough implementation projects are acceptable,
given that they meet all other requirements.

Project ideas:

- Quantum computability, and complexity
- Grammar and parser theory
- Heuristic approaches in NP-complete problems
- Automaton models not covered in the book

## Part 2: Final Presentation

Present your final project, paper, and/or program to the class.
Include a demo if applicable. Be prepared to answer questions
in-depth on your topic. Presentation lengths will vary from
10 minutes to a class period, depending on availability and
presenter preference: Quality and depth should be prioritized
over a specific presentation length.
